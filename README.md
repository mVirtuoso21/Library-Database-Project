# Library-Database-Project
This project manages a library database

This is one of my first projects that managed a database.

Make sure to setup the database in your localserver, I used mysql-connector-java-5.1.46 as follows: 
con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library", "root", "");
