# Library-Database-Project
This project manages a book library database

This is one of my first projects that managed a database.

Make sure to setup the "library" database in your localserver. 
I used mysql-connector-java-5.1.46 and set up the connection as follows: 
con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library", "root", "");
